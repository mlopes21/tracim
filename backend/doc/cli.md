Tracim has a build-in command line tool.

## Introduction ##

This document is intended to developers or sysadmin.

In order to use the `tracimcli` commands, go to the root of the project and
and active the Tracim virtualenv:

    user@host:~/tracim_backend$ source env/bin/activate
    (env) user@host:~/tracim_backend$

## Database ##

### Delete database /!\

This will drop all your database, be carefull !

    tracimcli db delete --force

    tracimcli user update -l "john@john@john.john" -p "mynewsuperpassword"

### Help

    tracimcli user create -h
    tracimcli user update -h

### Delete user(s)

Theses commands allow to delete user from database. Unlike deletion from tracim
ui which only make data not visible anymore, this command does delete content in
database, so you need to be careful using this.

user delete provide many parameter in order to choose how you want to delete user,
we suggest to anonymize them (see `-a` or `-b` ) if deleting them could create trouble.

```
$ tracimcli user delete -h
usage: tracimcli user delete [-h] [-c CONFIG_FILE] [-d] [-w] [-a] [-r] [-b]
                             [-f] [--dry-run] -l LOGINS [LOGINS ...]
                             [--anonymous-name ANONYMOUS_NAME]

Remove user and associated information from database

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIG_FILE, --config CONFIG_FILE
                        application config file to read (default:
                        development.ini)
  -d, --debug_mode      enable_tracim log for debug
  -w, --delete-owned-sharespaces
                        Delete also owned sharespaces of user
  -a, --anonymize-if-needed
                        anonymizes the user where he cannot be deleted
  -r, --delete-all-user-revisions
                        this allow to delete all user revisions. This may
                        create inconsistent database
  -b, --best-effort     trying doing the best deletion possible, same as -w -a
  -f, --force           force user deletion, same as -r -w. May create
                        inconsistent database
  --dry-run             dry-run mode
  -l LOGINS [LOGINS ...], --login LOGINS [LOGINS ...]
                        User logins (email)
  --anonymous-name ANONYMOUS_NAME
                        Anonymous user display name to use if anonymize option
                        is activated
```

### Anonymize user(s)

You can also anonymize user without deleting any user data user using
`tracimcli anonymize` command.

```
$ tracimcli user anonymize -h
usage: tracimcli user anonymize [-h] [-c CONFIG_FILE] [-d] [--dry-run]
                                [--anonymous-name ANONYMOUS_NAME] -l LOGINS
                                [LOGINS ...]

anonymize user from database

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

                        application config file to read (default:
                        development.ini)
